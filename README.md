üîç Key Insights

Average Metrics:

Stress Level: 1.00

Academic Performance: 2.77

Sleep Quality: 2.66

Academic Performance vs Stress: Students with lower academic performance tend to report higher stress levels.

Depression Impact: Higher depression levels correlate with lower sleep quality, increased stress, and weaker academic performance.

Bullying & Stress: Bullying is a significant driver of stress among students.

Study Load Effect: As study load increases, stress levels initially rise but show a downward trend at extreme levels (possibly due to adaptation or other factors).

Stress Distribution: Students are fairly evenly distributed across stress levels, with ~34% each reporting low, medium, and high stress.

‚öôÔ∏è DAX Usage

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to create calculated columns and measures, including:

Average and sum aggregations (e.g., avg_stress_lvl, avg_sleep_qlty, avg_performance).

Relationships between depression, sleep quality, stress, and academic outcomes.

Stress segmentation based on factors such as bullying, peer pressure, and study load.
